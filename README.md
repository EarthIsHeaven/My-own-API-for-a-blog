# My-own-API-for-a-blog

I have created a RESTful API for a blog that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The API is implemented in two JavaScript files: index.js and server.js.

The index.js file provides the data when the server requests the data using the API. The server.js file requests the index.js file for the data present in that API.
